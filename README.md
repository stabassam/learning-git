#Project Guidelines
As part of this project, we will be building an html based order form for a restaurant called Delish. The restaurant has three main items: Chicken Tikka Pizza, Juicy Steak and Delish Pasta and they require the following details from a customer: quantity of each item the customer wants to order from the menu, customer name, customer email, customer address, customer phone number. After a customer has selected the quantities, they should see the total amount of their order, considering that the price of the Pizza is $10, the price of the Juicy Steak is $8 and the price of the Pasta is $7.
